# Null Movement
In vanilla Minecraft, pressing both forward and backward or left and right will cause your character to come to a standstill from movement blocking.

If you use this mod, your movement will feel much smoother, and it could give a slight edge in certain situations such as PvP. This idea comes from a popular TF2/Source engine script.
